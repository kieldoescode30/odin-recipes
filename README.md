## Introduction
In this recipe project, I'll be practicing the HTML skills that I've learned so far. HTML Boilerplate, Paragraphs, text, lists, link and images.

## Day 1-3 (Journal)
So far I have learned CSS Basics like CSS Rules contains: a selector, a property and a value. There are many types of selectors like type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors and etc. I learned div containers are somewhat dividers in the page. I also learned the box-model and every element that is used in HTML are boxes and can be manipulated using padding, border and margin. I also learned display property which determines how the boxes behave in the page. Block, inline, and inline-block level elements are entirely different from each other and not all elements have the same box-sizing (very complicated and still struggling). And speaking of box-sizing, I also learned that border and padding add up to the size of the content in the element but with the power of "box-sizing: border-box" they all merge to the content size to make it the exact desired or declared width and height. With these powers and skills I have learned so far, I redesigned the index.html (main page) and my recipes page.
