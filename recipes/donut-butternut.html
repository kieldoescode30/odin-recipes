    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here’s the deal: we hacked into your childhood. As much as days past were fueled by fast food apple pies and supermarket-bought juice packets, it’s boxes of Munchkins that elevated the sugar high. If you were up for something light and airy, the snowy bavarian or strawberry jam-filled ones were top choice, while chocolate heads went for the Chocolate Honey-Dipped balls.</p>
    <p>Then, of course, there was the constantly in-demand line of orange powder-coated bonbons that always seemed to jump out in an otherwise neutral display of pastries: the Choco Butternut Munchkin. Food coloring achieves the bright orange coating and dark doughnuts.</p>
