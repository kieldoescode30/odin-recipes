        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 potatoes, washed</li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups fried chicken breading mix, like Shore Lunch or Oven Fry brand</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Cut the unpeeled potatoes into thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick. The thinner you cut them, the more crispy (like chips) they will get. I like to cut some a little thicker and some thinner.</li>
          <li>Place 1-2 cups oil (about one inch deep) in a large frying pan. Heat oil over medium heat until water sizzles across the top. While oil is heating, dip potato slices in milk and coat with the fried chicken breading mix.</li>
          <li>Carefully drop potatoes into the oil right away (so the batter doesn't get soggy) and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, adjusting heat as necessary.</li>
          <li>Remove and drain on a paper towel lined plate. Serve with ranch, ketchup, cheese, or any other kind of sauce.</li>
